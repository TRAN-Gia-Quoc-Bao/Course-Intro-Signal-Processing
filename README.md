# Exercises for Introduction to Signal Processing course
The exercises for this dedicated course in Introduction to Signal Processing were given in Labs from 1 to 4 and an exam on computer.

The questions are in French, but my comments in the codes and my reports and exam are in English.

This is an introductory course. A more advanced version is found at https://github.com/TRAN-Gia-Quoc-Bao/Course-Signal-Processing.

In the folders, there are the data materials, my codes, and my reports, i.e., my solutions and explanations to the Labs.

Contents:

Lab 1: Acquisition and reproduction of signals

Lab 2: Discrete Fourier transform

Lab 3: Synthesis of digital filters

Lab 4: Experiment with data

Exam: Analysis and processing of a digital signal
