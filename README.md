# Exercises for Introduction to Signal Processing course
The exercises for this dedicated course in Introduction to Signal Processing were given in Labs from 1 to 4 and an exam on computer.

The questions are in French, but my comments in the codes and my reports and exam are in English.

In the folders, there are the data materials, my codes, and my reports, i.e., my solutions and explanations to the Labs.

Contents:

Lab 1: Acquisition and reproduction of signals

Lab 2: Discrete Fourier transform

Lab 3: Synthesis of digital filters

Lab 4: Experiment with data

Exam: Analysis and processing of a digital signal
